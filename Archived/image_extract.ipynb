    "- This code extracts the CXR image png files from NIH CXR dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data). \n",
    "\n",
    "- The code assumes that the parent folder for all downloaded files from dataset is named `NIH-CXR/`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The extraction is focused on the images stored in the files named as `r\"images_\\d+\"` and there is a sub-folder of `images/` nested within each image folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code assumes that this code file is located on the same level as the `r\"images_\\d+\"` folders. Please change directories accordingly if the layout is different. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The sorting is based on the list of images provided in the `test_list.txt` and the `train_val_list.txt` files. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Images are sorted to target folders named `test_images` and `train_images` respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Code was employed in this file on the training images only and directories were previously created. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The testing images set was sorted via the raw, unrefactored file. Validation can be seen in the version history of this file on github(Note: Please excuse the mess). \n",
    "\n",
    "- The `image_extraction()` function takes in 3 arguements and gives status updates once per each image folder. The extraction of training images from `images_001/` folder took around 2.45 minutes before a status message was displayed. "
