# Examining Chest X-Rays Through Machine Learning

## Our Topic

### Selected Topic

#### To create a Machine Learning model that can analyze a patient's chest X-rays, classify lung disease severity, and subsequently expedite patient triaging in a more efficient manner. 

### Reasons for Selecting Topic

#### With the Covid-19 Pandemic straining the United States healthcare system due to its underlying inefficiencies, we became interested in examining a facet within this system that remains in need of address. Knowing that lung diseases left untreated and/or delayed have been associated with increased mortality rates, our model will attempt to limit such delays in treatment. 

## Our Data 

#### Data for this analysis will be sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data?select=README_CHESTXRAY.pdf), utilizing chest X-rays compiled by the ``National Institutes of Health``. The dataset includes 112,120 X-ray images from 30,805 unique patients. 

## Our Questions 

* How can a Machine Learning Model Be Devised to Identify & Classify Lung Diseases in Chest X-Rays?
* How can we use our Machine Learning Model to increase efficiency in lung disease treatment?
* How can a Machine Learning Model Be Implemented in a Real-World Medical Scenario? 

## Our Process & Communication Protocols

#### To facilitate collaboration, our group will primarily use our own Slack channel to share updates, questions and concerns.
