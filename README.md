## Abstract
Patients suffering from respiratory diseases often encounter delays in 
service based on the speed at which the disease is identified and diagnosed. Aside 
from symptomology and laboratory testing, diagnostic imaging via chest x-rays 
provides the most information regarding the state of the patientâ€™s lungs and the 
severity of the disease. As hospitals and emergency rooms continue to experience 
an increase in hospitalizations due to COVID-19, efficient triaging of resources 
becomes imperative to ensure that all patients receive the proper care and 
treatment necessary. To help expedite the process of disease characterization in 
patients suffering from respiratory illnesses, a Machine Learning model will be 
developed to quickly identify, and sort chest x-rays associated with high mortality 
diseases.
